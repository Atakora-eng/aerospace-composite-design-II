# Design and Optimization of Laser-Sintered Composites for Lightweight Structural Applications

## Abstract

This research explores the design and optimization of lightweight composites fabricated via laser sintering. Using SolidWorks, Python, and MATLAB, finite element analysis (FEA) simulations were conducted to model stress, strain, and thermal effects under variable loads. Experimental validation was performed using 3D printing and mechanical testing. Results demonstrate a closed-loop design approach that integrates physics-based theory with experimental validation, yielding improved strength-to-weight ratios for potential aerospace, robotics, and structural applications.

## 1. Introduction

Lightweight and durable materials are essential in fields such as aerospace, automotive, robotics, and space exploration. Traditional manufacturing often limits material efficiency and design flexibility. Laser sintering, a form of additive manufacturing, allows precise control of material distribution and microstructure. This research investigates how mathematical modeling, finite element analysis (FEA), and experimental testing can be combined to optimize laser-sintered composite structures.

**Research Question:** How can we optimize composite design to improve the strength-to-weight ratio using a combination of simulation and experimental validation?

**Objectives:**

* To design composite structures in SolidWorks for structural testing.
* To simulate stress, strain, and thermal performance using FEA.
* To fabricate and test prototypes using laser sintering.
* To validate models and refine optimization algorithms.
